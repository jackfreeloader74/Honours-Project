December 1st - Created mockup wireframes of what the application will look like/how it navigates

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


December 10th - Wrote out a step by step plan on how to achieve a working prototype

  Write Simple optimization algorithm MPT (uses 4 set tickers)

  Set up flask server with basic page (with a submit button called generate portfolio)

  Add javascript ajax post request

  Add server logic for processing this post request

  Link optimization algoritm call function to the post request

  Add input form on html page for stock ticker input and modify optimization function to take these tickers as parameters
  and use them as input.

  Add redirect of generate portfolio to go to a portfolio summary 
  
  Get servers calculated sharpe ratio from optimzation and return it to the client so it shows up on the page
  
 
 
  Alter optimization code so that it can return the weights of the optimimum portfolio
  
  Use weights to build a pie chart
  
  Return pie chart to client so it displays on page
  
  Change html css to provide a portfolio summary template (Show all this info in a structured way)
  
  
  PREDICTED ERROR VALIDATION
  Return error if the input is not a valid ticker
  
  Quality of life tasks
  Generating portfolio takes a while - Will probably need some sort of loading screen/icon

Managed to get a template image on server returned to the clients html page. This can be used for a matplotlib graph

Looking at PDF return mechanisms specifically file pathing and came across idea that server should be hosted on apache not a local host?
Need to ask David about this. Functionally speaking as a widely used app yes this would be needed.

Validate Tickers,
Add tickers as input to optimization (will probably needed to be sorted alphabetically)
Add expected return to front end post request
Change optimization to find based on that risk



10th January----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ticker Validation - Test if tickers are case sensitive. If they are they input will need to be capitalized
Invalid tickers - Find a way to return a friendly user error to say that the ticker they provided is not valid
Ticker Sorting -> For the algorithm to work the tickers must be provided alphabetically. User input will need to be sorted
GeneratePDF not working. Need to investigate

For report, can talk about optimization code:

Use adj Close to calculate returns, what is this and why do we use it?




13th Jan -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed PDF generation. Problem was wkhtmltopdf fails to identify certain bootstrap html/css

I have created an API specification that tries to outline the different requests that the server needs to be able to handle. Includes
appropriate response codes (404, 500 etc...), the method used (POST, GET), the URL and the response format. (HTML, plaintext etc..)

Had to fix an issue with browser storing data in cache. In particular this was an image the client was pulling from the server and
was not being updated properly. This was done by disabling cache for the application

I added the mechanism to validate tickers. Now i need to format the response correctly so when user puts in an invalid ticker, 
a message shows up on the idnex page saying "Ticker X is invalid. Please enter a valid ticker".

Current priorities are:

1) Add complete response messsage to index screen for an invalid ticker
2) Add complete portfolio info to PDF (weights, tickers etc)


Side tasks:

1) Add dynamic loading screen icon to index page for portfolio generation
2) Round the weights of the optimized portfolio before redirecting to the new page ( Makes the URL look tidier)
3) General CSS changes to improve visual appeal
4) Create Gantt chart summarising all remaining tasks for the project




January 16th----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPLETED:
Added the response message to index screen for invalid ticker.
Added weights and tickers to PDF. 
Added risk and sharpe value to summary page and pdf
Added efficient frontier graph to summary and pdf 
Added Client and server validation for putting in duplicate tickers
Changed summary and pdf to look better

Current Priorities are:

Update wireframe to include dropdown for optimziation methods
Implement dropdown
Create gannt chart

Side tasks
  Load icon
  Round weights before they are put in the URL

Had meeting with david + discussions over email
  
 Main points were that it could be worth having a few saved templates of portfolio tickers just for the sake of testing and doing a demo
 (Saves me having to type in the symbols every time. Linked to this is a potential addition (only if there is enough time, is to add a sql database that can store portfolio details). I suppose this would also require a new page + service to retrieve them. (theoretically it would be linked to a user but for the sake of the project it could just be you get access to all portfolios in the db)
 
 Second point, when displaying the weights of the portfolio e.g. 30% of AMZN, rather than just a %, also display this in raw numbers.
 E.g. in a £10,000 investment this £30,000 amazon purchase would be equal to x amount of shares

from discussion with dad

Could include a graph that highlightes the portfolios value over time if invested in 2015-2020. Could also include hard numbers
like if you invested in this in 2015 by 2020 the return would be x

Fixed issue with checkbox. In forms, the value of the checkbox is only posted when it is "on". Had to wrap server side capturing of checkbox value in a try catch.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19/20th Jan

Added a preset button that fills in the form with 4 static ticker symbols to reduce time for testing and during a demo
Changed the rounding of the weights to occur before they are passed into the URL, making it look tidier


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21st Jan

Added an optional cash investment input that will be used to inform the user of how many shares of each asset they would need to purchase to form the generated portfolio ( This probably should be updated into the requirements). So far it just sends the value to the server and I have just started to do the calculation logic with it.

Convert cash value from £ to $
For each stock, multiply the total cash investment by its corresponding weight (generated by the optimization algorithm)
Then multiply this value by the current adj close for that stock on the current day


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24th Jan

Added functionality to calculate the number of shares that can be purchased. This info is now displayed as a 3rd column in the portfolio
summary page table.

Had to consider rounding the share count but found out that you can purchase partial shares so no need to round down

THIS NEW FEATURE NEEDS TO BE ADDED TO THE REQUIREMENTS

Next thing to work on could be the graph highlighting past portfolio performance (line graph)
