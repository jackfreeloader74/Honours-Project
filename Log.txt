December 1st - Created mockup wireframes of what the application will look like/how it navigates


December 10th - Wrote out a step by step plan on how to achieve a working prototype

  Write Simple optimization algorithm MPT (uses 4 set tickers)

  Set up flask server with basic page (with a submit button called generate portfolio)

  Add javascript ajax post request

  Add server logic for processing this post request

  Link optimization algoritm call function to the post request

  Add input form on html page for stock ticker input and modify optimization function to take these tickers as parameters
  and use them as input.

  Add redirect of generate portfolio to go to a portfolio summary 
  
  Get servers calculated sharpe ratio from optimzation and return it to the client so it shows up on the page
  
  
 
  Alter optimization code so that it can return the weights of the optimimum portfolio
  
  Use weights to build a pie chart
  
  Return pie chart to client so it displays on page
  
  Change html css to provide a portfolio summary template (Show all this info in a structured way)
  
  
  PREDICTED ERROR VALIDATION
  Return error if the input is not a valid ticker
  
  Quality of life tasks
  Generating portfolio takes a while - Will probably need some sort of loading screen/icon
