December 1st - Created mockup wireframes of what the application will look like/how it navigates

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


December 10th - Wrote out a step by step plan on how to achieve a working prototype

  Write Simple optimization algorithm MPT (uses 4 set tickers)

  Set up flask server with basic page (with a submit button called generate portfolio)

  Add javascript ajax post request

  Add server logic for processing this post request

  Link optimization algoritm call function to the post request

  Add input form on html page for stock ticker input and modify optimization function to take these tickers as parameters
  and use them as input.

  Add redirect of generate portfolio to go to a portfolio summary 
  
  Get servers calculated sharpe ratio from optimzation and return it to the client so it shows up on the page
  
 
 
  Alter optimization code so that it can return the weights of the optimimum portfolio
  
  Use weights to build a pie chart
  
  Return pie chart to client so it displays on page
  
  Change html css to provide a portfolio summary template (Show all this info in a structured way)
  
  
  PREDICTED ERROR VALIDATION
  Return error if the input is not a valid ticker
  
  Quality of life tasks
  Generating portfolio takes a while - Will probably need some sort of loading screen/icon
  
  
  
  


23rd December--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Managed to get a template image on server returned to the clients html page. This can be used for a matplotlib graph

Looking at PDF return mechanisms specifically file pathing and came across idea that server should be hosted on apache not a local host?
Need to ask David about this. Functionally speaking as a widely used app yes this would be needed.

Validate Tickers,
Add tickers as input to optimization (will probably needed to be sorted alphabetically)
Add expected return to front end post request
Change optimization to find based on that risk



10th January----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ticker Validation - Test if tickers are case sensitive. If they are they input will need to be capitalized
Invalid tickers - Find a way to return a friendly user error to say that the ticker they provided is not valid
Ticker Sorting -> For the algorithm to work the tickers must be provided alphabetically. User input will need to be sorted
GeneratePDF not working. Need to investigate

For report, can talk about optimization code:

Use adj Close to calculate returns, what is this and why do we use it?




13th Jan -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed PDF generation. Problem was wkhtmltopdf fails to identify certain bootstrap html/css

I have created an API specification that tries to outline the different requests that the server needs to be able to handle. Includes
appropriate response codes (404, 500 etc...), the method used (POST, GET), the URL and the response format. (HTML, plaintext etc..)

Had to fix an issue with browser storing data in cache. In particular this was an image the client was pulling from the server and
was not being updated properly. This was done by disabling cache for the application

I added the mechanism to validate tickers. Now i need to format the response correctly so when user puts in an invalid ticker, 
a message shows up on the idnex page saying "Ticker X is invalid. Please enter a valid ticker".

Current priorities are:

1) Add complete response messsage to index screen for an invalid ticker
2) Add complete portfolio info to PDF (weights, tickers etc)


Side tasks:

1) Add dynamic loading screen icon to index page for portfolio generation
2) Round the weights of the optimized portfolio before redirecting to the new page ( Makes the URL look tidier)
3) General CSS changes to improve visual appeal
4) Create Gantt chart summarising all remaining tasks for the project




January 16th----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMPLETED:
Added the response message to index screen for invalid ticker.
Added weights and tickers to PDF. 
Added risk and sharpe value to summary page and pdf
Added efficient frontier graph to summary and pdf 
Added Client and server validation for putting in duplicate tickers
Changed summary and pdf to look better

Current Priorities are:

Update wireframe to include dropdown for optimziation methods
Implement dropdown
Create gannt chart

Side tasks
  Load icon
  Round weights before they are put in the URL



17th Jan -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Had meeting with david + discussions over email
  
 Main points were that it could be worth having a few saved templates of portfolio tickers just for the sake of testing and doing a demo
 (Saves me having to type in the symbols every time. Linked to this is a potential addition (only if there is enough time, is to add a sql database that can store portfolio details). I suppose this would also require a new page + service to retrieve them. (theoretically it would be linked to a user but for the sake of the project it could just be you get access to all portfolios in the db)
 
 Second point, when displaying the weights of the portfolio e.g. 30% of AMZN, rather than just a %, also display this in raw numbers.
 E.g. in a £10,000 investment this £30,000 amazon purchase would be equal to x amount of shares
 
 
 


18th Jan -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

from discussion with dad

Could include a graph that highlightes the portfolios value over time if invested in 2015-2020. Could also include hard numbers
like if you invested in this in 2015 by 2020 the return would be x

Fixed issue with checkbox. In forms, the value of the checkbox is only posted when it is "on". Had to wrap server side capturing of checkbox value in a try catch.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19/20th Jan

Added a preset button that fills in the form with 4 static ticker symbols to reduce time for testing and during a demo
Changed the rounding of the weights to occur before they are passed into the URL, making it look tidier


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21st Jan

Added an optional cash investment input that will be used to inform the user of how many shares of each asset they would need to purchase to form the generated portfolio ( This probably should be updated into the requirements). So far it just sends the value to the server and I have just started to do the calculation logic with it.

Convert cash value from £ to $
For each stock, multiply the total cash investment by its corresponding weight (generated by the optimization algorithm)
Then multiply this value by the current adj close for that stock on the current day


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24th Jan

Added functionality to calculate the number of shares that can be purchased. This info is now displayed as a 3rd column in the portfolio
summary page table.

Had to consider rounding the share count but found out that you can purchase partial shares so no need to round down
THIS NEW FEATURE NEEDS TO BE ADDED TO THE REQUIREMENTS

Also realised that the stock value is in dollars but the cash value from the user is asked for in £. Had to use 
currencyConverter library to do the conversion




Next thing to work on could be the graph highlighting past portfolio performance (line graph)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

26th Jan 

Ran into an interesting bug where the application does not work on a sunday? To get the amount of shares the user can purchase,
it makes an api call to get the current value of the share on todays date. However this date fails if the day is a sunday, maybe due
to the way stock markets work? Will need to provide a workaround, if today is a sunday, use a saturday instead. 

This bug also extends further where if you request it on any day Monday-Saturday in the morning UK time the NASDAQ is still closed. Doesnt open till 2:30pm UK time. 

LOGIC ->

If its a sunday, use a saturday
If the time is before 3pm, use the day before (unless the day before is a sunday)


Added a new graph to the summary page that shows the portfolios value in cash over time. 

Doing this made me think about how the value of this portfolio does not include dividends provided by the stock over time.
A potentially new requirement could be to sum up the cash received in dividends over the same time period as the graph in order to show the extra income that would also be generated.

Beyond this which could be way to difficult but it would be to include the idea of dividend reinvestment, 
e.g. if you invested in these stocks, and reinvested all the dividends received in this time frame back into the same stocks, what would the graph of total portfolio value be?  I am pretty sure I can do just the simple dividend calculation but the reinvesment part is unclear.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Log for the 30th of Jan

I have added a new input field on the home page for portfolio size (number of companies to invest in).
Other changes to both client and server side means that the table on the summary screen that details weights and share count can 
now be of dynamic lenght. E.g. Specify portfolio of 3 and the table will have have 3 rows.

This will be the setup for the followign scenario:

User inputs a size  of 4 but leaves 2 tickers blank. Application must select build a portfolio using the 2 provided tickers, and find  other stocks to meet the size requirement.

Might need to make use of angular JS so that the value in the portfolio size input box will dynamically disable input boxes.

E.g if you enter a size of 3, the application should blank and disable the 4th input box

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

User is informed of the sharpe ratio but could be worth telling them what that means? Maybe have some sort of number line type image
that shows how good the sharpe ratio is:

A Sharpe ratio of 1.0 is considered acceptable.
A Sharpe ratio of 2.0 is considered very good.
A Sharpe ratio of 3.0 is considered excellent.
A Sharpe ratio of less than 1.0 is considered to be poor. 



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alot of the new changes to the portfolio summary page like the new table as well as the dynamic sizing of the existing table needed to be copied over onto the generated PDF. This has now been done. Only issue i found was PDF kit was displaying currency symbols (£) in a weird way. Fix for this was to add to the html page "<meta charset="UTF-8"/>

2 Biggest priorities:
 
Design and implement a way of displaying to users the top 100 public traded companies along with their corresponding ticker.

API Backup - Write data from a yahoo finance API call into a csv, then add an option to use that as the data to generate the portfolio from instead of the API call

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

09/02/20120

I have added a new popup to the main page that displays a list of publically traded companies and their corresponding ticker

I have added option in the code so that the financial data will be read from an already saved csv file. This is what will be used as the backup incase yahoo API goes down.

I have updated the web pages to have a nicer looking navigation bar. Also added a new "About" page which provides the user with the theory behind the optimization methods that the applicaiton uses to generate portfolios.

4 more stock input boxes have been added to the index page (Allowing for a maximum portfolio size of 8)

Current priorities:

  Complete the auto selection of stocks (E.g. user selects portfolio size of 8 but only inputs 4 stocks, app must select another 4 on
  behalf of the user).

  Fix the current bug where the weights sometimes dont add up to 100%
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Bug where weights were not adding up to 100% has been fixed. Was due to rounding error.
  
  Added the groundwork for autoselection of stocks.
    Had to change the stock input handling logic so that it knows when it needs to fill in the stocks itself.
    At the moment the app can calculate how many stocks it needs to generate in order to meet the requirements.
    
    As for the actual choosing of stocks, I have found csv files that list all nasdaq stocks and their corresponding industries. I can use this to select meaningfull stocks via industry. E.g they have 4 stocks in technology and energy. App could then see this and add a stock from finance sector and a stock from healthcare. ( This makes the selection much more meaningfull than just random selection ).
    
 I have used this data to create a new column on the summary page -> "Sector". Informs the user of the sector that each stock is from.


CURRENT PRIORITIES:

  Use this sector data to create a pie chart that shows a breakdown of sectors in the portfolio
 
  Develop the auto selection algorithm.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10/02/2020

Did informal testing with Caitlin

1) Move "Enter stocks in ticker form" instruction from after the inputs to before (Since user is reading form top to bottom)

2) Above pie chart that specifies portfolio weight breakdown -> Specify what the chart represents in form of a title

3) Labels on all charts need to be bigger

4) On portfolio performane chart, change title "Portfolio performance" to "Portfolio Performance over last x year"

5) Portfolio summary table 1, add short hand variables to the column names:

Go from ->   "Annual Expected Return        Volatility             Sharpe Ratio"

To    ->   "Annual Expected Return(AER)        Volatility (V)             Sharpe Ratio (AER/V)

This helps user understands what sharpe ratio is

NOTE -> Caitlin is not familiar with financial terminology and stock market theory so the testing feedback was mainly focused on UI layout

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11/02/2020

Further feedback from caitlin ( most of the suggestions from last session has been implemented )

1)  Change button that shows a list of stocks and tickers from "View Stocks" to "View Popular Stocks"

2)  For the slider/checkbox -> Have both text options show on either side and have the one currently selected, highlighted in bold.

  E.g.    Find Best Risk to reward ratio   []   Specify minimum level of return
  
  This makes the functionality clearer and easier to understand for the user.
  
3) Potentially add a popup that spawns when you open the application (or opens via a button ) that in detail explains how the app works
  It's would be quite difficult to explain in detail how the auto selection works and what the optimization means so a way to explain
  this to the user would be usefull. ( This is not part of the requirements so may only be implemented if I have time ).

15/02/2020

Did informal testing with Nick:
( Had more comments on the finance logic than UI presentation and layout )


Share count column - move money value (10,000 to the top table) 
and add an extra column on the table 2 for the current share price.

The expected return value on table 1 should be a %

The stock name column in table 2 should be the stocks actual name and not a ticker

Point to express -> The algorithm looks over a 10 year period. Amazon did really well in that time (huge increase in share price)
but that level of increase is often not sustainable and will peak off. Despite this the algorithm will always favour putting more in amazon because of this. This highlightes the weakness of MPT




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17/02/2020

1) Completed sector pie chart breakdown

2) Came across bug in application with the finance API when calculating the current share price of a stock. The date logic
only accounted for weekends and out of hours trading when the stock market is closed.

This does not account for the holidays throughout the year where the market is also closed. E.g. presidents day, thanksgiving.
Had to right code that used a different date if the today is a holiday.

3) Added the majority of logic for stock autoselection. Now if you enter no stocks on the submission page, the app will find the required number of portfolios and will do so via sector.

Specifically each time it tries to select a stock, it will look at which sector is currently least invested in:

E.g. Portfolio size of 4 and user has provided:

AMZN - Consumer Services
AAPL - TECHNOLOGY
XOM - Energy

The app will see that the user has no investments in the finance sector so will select a stock from that industry to add to the portfolio. E.g. Leisure Acquisition Corp


I will still need to test some other scenarios for auto-selection to make sure it all works.

Current priorities:

 1) Perform more testing and fixes for stock auto-selection
 2) Perform ground work for alternate optimization algorithm (Sortino ratio)  
  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26/02/2020

Completed testing of autoselection of stocks

Added sortino Ratio option for portfolio generation. Finds the portfolio with the highest sortino ratio.
Includes a new dropdown menu on index page
